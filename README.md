Hi there, welcome! I'm Natasha, a developer+designer based in ATL! I am an incoming MS-HCI student at Georgia Tech, where I graduated this May with my Bachelor's in Computational Media, and I have a keen interest in community, collaboration and creativity! I'm currently interning as a UX Research and Design intern at GT Office of Information Technology! I have presented my work on design collaboration at ACM SIGDOC, TA'd for Education Technology, and SWE'd @NCR. Take a look around, and I'm always down to chat [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natashavalluri/)!

My alter ego on github is [@natasha-png!](https://www.github.com/natasha-png)
